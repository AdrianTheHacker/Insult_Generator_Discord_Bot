A list of stuff to implement, and the priority of said stuff.

1. Finish and test EnvFileReader

2. Finish basic discord client -> [DONE]
    - Should be able to say hello in text channels
      using slash commands

3. Add slash command for voting
    - This should have two parameters:
        1) The name of the poll
        2) A list of all the Options
            - These will likely be emojis

    - The person who started that poll 
      will choose when it ends.
